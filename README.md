## Installation

I moved to [vim-plug][vim-plug] a while ago and never looked back. Anyway, you
can install Gotham with whatever package manager you use. For example:

``` viml
" vim-plug
Plug 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
" NeoBundle
NeoBundle 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
" Vundle
Plugin 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
```

If you use pathogen, clone the repository inside `~/.vim/bundle`:

    git clone https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham ~/.vim/bundle

If you don't use a plugin manager just copy the content of `colors/` to
`~/.vim/colors`.
